## About Me
I'm a passionate Computer Science Student currently studying at Maejo University. I have always been interested in technology and how it can be used to solve problems and improve people's lives. Apart from that, I am also a big fan of gaming, and I love to spend my free time playing video games or messing around with people on the internet.

## A Little More About Me
My pen name is Codename_T, and I'm just a simple 20-year-old from Thailand. I enjoy sitting immersed in front of the screen and focus on my code in my free time. Programming is not only a hobby for me but a way of life. I love to learn and explore new technologies and always try to improve my skills.

While I consider myself a kind person, I do have a salty side. I apologize in advance if I ever come across that way. It's just my passion for what I do that sometimes gets the better of me.

## Why I'm Here
Ever since I was a young boy, I have always wanted to make an impact on the world. I wanted to do something that matters and connect with people everywhere. I believe that through technology, we can make a difference and create a better world for everyone. While things may not have gone exactly as planned, I'm still having a good time learning and growing every day.

## What I Do
I have a strong background in software development and am proficient in several programming languages, including **PHP, Javascript, Python, HTML, and CSS**. I also have experience working with popular frameworks like **CodeIgniter 4, VueJS, and Bootstrap**, which I often use to build complex applications that meet my clients' unique needs. In addition, I'm well-versed in various databases, including **MySQL and Firebase.**

As a lifelong learner, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and try new things. That's why I'm currently focused on learning cutting-edge technologies like **Go, Typescript, and Nuxt.** I believe that keeping up with the latest trends and tools is crucial for staying competitive in the fast-paced world of software development.
